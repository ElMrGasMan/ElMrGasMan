- 👨‍🎓 I'm a Programming student in the "Universidad Tecnologica Nacional" of Argentina. More specifically, the career is called "Tecnicatura Universitaria en Programación", which it's rough translation is "University Technician in Programming".

- ♠ I have moderate experience in **Java** and **C#**. Modest, and a little bit in **C**. And I once worked in the backend of a web page in **DJango**.

- 🎮 I also have experience in game development in **Godot**, which is my favourite engine, and *some* in **Unity**.

- ✨ I'm currently focused on finishing the career and working with a small studio to make our first game in Godot.
